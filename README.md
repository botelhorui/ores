# ores
As we talked, I’m sending you our Technical Challenge. Your deadline will be the 5th of November. Any doubts or questions let us know. 

Objective:
-To evaluate the technical skills of the applicant.
-You should pay attention to how the code is structured and how much it fits the requirements below, as well as the choice of data structures used.
-We will also pay attention to the fun factor of the game. Smoothness, animations, and any extra features added.
 
 
Game Requirements:
x-Boxes stack vertically
x-Boxes have different colors
x-When a box disappears, any box that is adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to it and of the same color will disappear
x-When a box disappears, any boxes that are on top of it, fall down to replace it
x-When clicked, a box that has at least an adjacent box of the same color will disappear
x-Periodically, a new column of (random) boxes pushes all the columns sideways
x-If there is a gap between columns, boxes will collapse towards the earlier columns
x-If any box reaches the end zone the game ends
-Check "Ores" for details and inspiration

- You may be creative in terms of start conditions, difficulty, timings and visuals
 
Rules:
+You must develop the game in C++ or objective-c
+You must use libSDL for rendering (http://www.libsdl.org/)
+You may use additional sdl libraries to handle image and text loading and rendering
+You may NOT use any external game engine (cocosx, unity, udk, etc…)
+You will deliver the source code, and a prebuilt version of your game that we can try without installing any external players/libraries.
 
Evaluation:
We will look at your source code to evaluate:
Overall structure and organization of code.
Performance & memory considerations. Please take special consideration to the code quality.
 
We will also run the prebuilt game (preferably OSX) and evaluate:
The ”feeling” when playing the game i.e. Attention to transitions, animations and other details that might enhance the user experience.
How the test performs against the specification.
 
You may use free images or sounds to improve the quality of your prototype.
Delivery should be done through a zip file (with your name) with the full sources and a readme.txt file explaining where the executable is. Is should be run directly without any installation.
